### Tasks

#### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

- `0-positive_or_negative.py` - Prints if a number is positive, zero or negative.

#### 1. The last digit

- `1-last_digit.py` - Prints the last digit of a random number.

#### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

- `2-print_alphabet.py` - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

#### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

- `3-print_alphabt.py` - Prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, except `q` and `e`.

#### 4. Hexadecimal printing
- `4-print_hexa.py` - a program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal.

#### 5. 00...99

- `5-print_comb2.py` - a program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`.

#### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

- `6-print_comb3.py` - a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

#### 7. islower

- `7-islower.py` - a function that checks for lowercase character.

#### 8. To uppercase

- `8-uppercase.py` - a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

#### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

- `9-print_last_digit.py` - a function that prints the last digit of a number.

#### 10. a + b

- `10-add.py` - a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

#### 11. a ^ b

- `11-pow.py` - a function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value.

#### 12. Fizz Buzz

- `12-fizzbuzz.py` - a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. *For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.*

#### 13. Insert in sorted linked list

- `13-insert_number.c` - a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

#### 14. Smile in the mirror

- `100-print_tebahpla.py` - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (`z` in lowercase and `Y` in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

#### 15. Remove at position

- `101-remove_char_at.py` - a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n` (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

#### 16. ByteCode -> Python #2

- `102-magic_calculation.py` - a Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b, c):`
